# Hangman

My second "reel" project at BeCode. The purpose was to make us understand and use the concept of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in python in the form of a game called "Hangman".

## Installation

Just download the git repository and keep the files. You only need python3

## Usage 

```python
 python3 main.py
```
 the game will directly start by asking you to input a letter, after that they check if the letter was good or not. You only have 5 chance to find the word be careful
